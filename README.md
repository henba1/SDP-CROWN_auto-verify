# SDP-CROWN_auto-verify: Efficient Bound Propagation for Neural Network Verification with Tightness of Semidefinite Programming

This version of SDP-CROWN is adapted to function with [auto-verify](https://github.com/ADA-research/auto-verify) version >= 1.0.0.

**Note:** Credit for the SDP-CROWN verifier goes to Chiu et al. and the OVAL Research Group.
